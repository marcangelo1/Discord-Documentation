Channels don't appear in the expected location or are missing entirely. Incorrect channel hierarchy or visibility settings. Drag and drop to reorder, check if the channel is nested unexpectedly, ensure visibility settings. Difficulty setting up complex channel permissions or a large number of channels. Overly granular permissions, or a need for role-specific channels Simplify permissions, use broader roles, or create dedicated roles for specific channel access.

Double-check the token, ensure the code is running and actively listening (check logs, errors). Bot has limited functionality or cannot access certain features. Missing permissions or incorrect OAuth2 scopes. Verify the necessary permissions in the Developer Portal. Review scopes and re-invite the bot if needed. Unexpected behavior or errors from the bot. Bugs or logic errors in the bot's code. Debug your code, analyze logs/errors. Use print statements or a debugger to trace problems. Unable to start or join an activity. Incorrect permissions, or issues with the activity itself. Ensure the user has \"Create Activity\" permissions. Check if the activity type is still available/supported.
