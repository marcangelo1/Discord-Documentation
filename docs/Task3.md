???+ Note "Missing rocket ship icon"

    - Not all servers support Discord Activities. If you don't see the rocket ship icon in a voice channel, it's likely Activities aren't enabled for that server.
    - Contact a server moderator or admin to check if they're allowed and resolve potential permission issues.
