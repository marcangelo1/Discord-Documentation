**3.** Click the rocket ship icon near the bottom of your screen. It's right next to your Video and Screen Share buttons.

???+ Note "Missing rocket ship icon"

    - Not all servers support Discord Activities. If you don't see the rocket ship icon in a voice channel, it's likely Activities aren't enabled for that server.
    - Contact a server moderator or admin to check if they're allowed and resolve potential permission issues.

**4.** Check the list to see if any activities are running. You'll see their names and icons if any are active.
