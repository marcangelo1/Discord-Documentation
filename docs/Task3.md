???+ Note "Missing rocket ship icon"

    - Not all servers support Discord Activities. If you don't see the rocket ship icon in a voice channel, it's likely Activities aren't enabled for that server.
    - Contact a server moderator or admin to check if they're allowed and resolve potential permission issues.

**4.** Check the list to see if any activities are running. You'll see their names and icons if any are active.

**5.** Move your mouse over the voice channel name where the activity is being played. A **"Join Activity"** button will appear. Click it!
