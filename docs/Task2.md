# **Setting Up a Server Bot: Creation and Integration**

## Overview
Discord bots are cool helpers that make your chat server more fun and keep things in order. They can tell jokes, run games, or make sure people follow the rules.This section helps you understand Discord bot accounts and guides you through the creation and integration process.

??? Question "What is a Discord bot account and what can you do with it?"

    Think of a Discord bot as a helpful automated program on your server. You'll need a dedicated Discord bot account separate from your user account to control and manage these custom bots.

    - **Manage Your Bot:** Configure its settings, commands, and presence on your server.
    - **Run Pre-Built Bots:** Add and customize many existing bots from online repositories, covering moderation, fun games, and more.
    - **Connect to Self-Coded Bots:** Link the bot account to advanced custom bots you've developed yourself (this does require programming knowledge).


!!! Note
    This guide doesn't cover building or coding the bot's functionality. That's a separate, more technical process often involving programming knowledge.

## How to Add Your Bot to Your Discord Server

<!-- Adding a bot lets its code run on your Discord server. First, you'll invite the bot to your server. Then, you'll grant it specific permissions â€“ these control what the bot can do, such as reading messages, sending messages, or managing roles. Once added, the bot will become active and be able to interact with your server members. -->

**1.** Ensure you're logged in to [**Discord Developer Portal website**](https://discord.com/developers/applications){: style="color: #7289DA;"}  with the account you used to create your bot.  

**2.** Navigate to the applications page. Then, under **My Applications**, select your desired application.
