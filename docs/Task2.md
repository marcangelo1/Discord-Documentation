- **Run Pre-Built Bots:** Add and customize many existing bots from online repositories, covering moderation, fun games, and more.

Then, you'll grant it specific permissions â€“ these control what the bot can do, such as reading messages, sending messages, or managing roles. Once added, the bot will become active and be able to interact with your server members. -->
