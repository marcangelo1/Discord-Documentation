| Symptoms                                                  | Probable Cause                                            | Action                                                                                                     |

| Unable to create, delete, or edit channels/categories. Channel names or category organization unexpectedly changed. | Missing permissions.                                      | Verify roles have "Manage Channels" and "Manage Roles" permissions. Adjust within category/channel settings. |
| Channels don't appear in the expected location or are missing entirely.        | Incorrect channel hierarchy or visibility settings.       | Drag and drop to reorder, check if the channel is nested unexpectedly, ensure visibility settings.           |
| Difficulty setting up complex channel permissions or a large number of channels.     | Overly granular permissions, or a need for role-specific channels | Simplify permissions, use broader roles, or create dedicated roles for specific channel access.            |
| Bot doesn't appear online or does not respond to commands. | Bot token incorrect, or the bot's code is not running.    | Double-check the token, ensure the code is running and actively listening (check logs, errors).              |
| Bot has limited functionality or cannot access certain features. | Missing permissions or incorrect OAuth2 scopes.           | Verify the necessary permissions in the Developer Portal. Review scopes and re-invite the bot if needed.     |
| Unexpected behavior or errors from the bot.                | Bugs or logic errors in the bot's code.                   | Debug your code, analyze logs/errors. Use print statements or a debugger to trace problems.                  |
| Unable to start or join an activity.                       | Incorrect permissions, or issues with the activity itself. | Ensure the user has "Create Activity" permissions. Check if the activity type is still available/supported.  |
| Activity doesn't function correctly or crashes.            | Issues with the activity's code or integration.           | Verify correct game/application linking. Ensure the activity implementation code is accurate and bug-free.   |
| Poor performance or lag during an activity                 | Network issues, or resource limitations on user devices.  | Troubleshoot network (bandwidth, stability). Close unnecessary applications to free up resources.            |
